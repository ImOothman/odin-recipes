    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is creamy and cheesy, with a delicious mix of spices coming 
        together to create a mouth watering explosion of flavour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Fettucine pasta</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>1 Onion</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Sundried Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Chicken stock</li>
            <li>Heavy cream</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
         </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Combine all the spices and herbs for the seasoning blend in a small bowl and set aside. Lay the chicken breasts onto a sheet tray or plate and season both sides with about half of the seasoning blend. Sprinkle them with the 2 Tbsp of flour on both sides and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add the olive oil and chicken breasts. Sear the chicken till golden brown, about 3-4 minutes for each side. Remove from the pan and place into the oven at 350 F, for about 10-12 minutes to finish cooking.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is in the oven make the sauce: to the same pan you seared the chicken in, add a little more olive oil and the chopped white onion. Saute over medium high heat until the onion softened, about 3-4 minutes then add in the chopped jalapeno and minced garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and beginning to brown, about 1-2 minutes then add in the sun dried tomatoes, thyme leaves and chicken stock. Cook another minute, scraping up any browned bits on the pan then stir in the heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Once the cream starts simmering, stir in the grated parmesan and cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce is thickened and slightly reduced. Toss in the cooked pasta with the sauce and remove from the heat. Remove the chicken from the oven, slice the cooked chicken breasts and serve on top of the creamy, sauced pasta.</li>
        </ol>
