    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class = "text"><ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375 F. Place a large skillet over medium high heat and add a drizzle of oil to the pan. </li>
            <li>Once the pan is hot and the oil is shimmering, add the thinly sliced steak and stir to separate the pieces out evenly. 
            Let cook, undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until the steak is golden brown. Stir to flip the steak, then add the onion and 
            peppers. Let cook, stirring occasionally for 2-3 more minutes, until the onion and peppers are softened.</li>
            <li>Add the worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper and continue to cook 2-3 more minutes. Stir in the cheese whiz sauce 
            and remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <li>Place the cut rolls onto a sheet tray and layer all the steak and veggies onto the bottom layer of buns. 
            Place the sliced provolone evenly over the top layer of the buns.</li>
            <li>Put the cheesesteaks in the oven for 6-8 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubblings and the buns are golden brown 
            and toasted.</li>
            <li>While the sliders are in the oven, melt the butter in a small pot and once bubbling, remove from heat and stir in 
            the chopped cilantro and grated garlic.</li>
            <li>Place the top layer on the steak layer, brush liberally with the cilantro garlic butter, then transfer 
            to a cutting board and cut the buns into slider portions. Serve with extra cheese sauce for dipping and enjoy.</li>
